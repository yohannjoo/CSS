            <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a samll and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developors to take it in a bunch of different diretions. JavaScript lives inside a hose environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storign data values - Imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifies. <span>var x;</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x=10;</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>True</span> or <span>False;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span>or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>'Coding Dojo Rocks!';</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decision - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specifiecd condition is true, do this code in our block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and you top. Thats a loop!</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run the code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
